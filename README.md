The Starship Shooter


Project Pitch
For this project, we plan to make a starship shooter game. What that means is that the program we will be making is a game where you shoot incoming enemies using a starship that you, the player, control.

At the moment, we plan to make the game consist of only one level, but with some rough ideas for difficulty levels. The game could consist of a ranking system similar to the design of the dino run game that can be played on a browser when the internet is down, where for that game, your score increases the longer you survive, and at certain milestone points achieved, the ship starts to sail progressively faster, making it harder to either dodge or shoot incoming obstacles.
